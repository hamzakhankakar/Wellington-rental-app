     <h1> Wellington Property Nightmares </h1>
     <br />
     <br />
     <p>Wellington’s housing market is a pressure cooker, with soaring prices and fierce competition turning homeownership dreams into nightmares. The capital’s median house price hovers around $1.2 million, pricing out first-time buyers and forcing many into a cutthroat rental market. Limited supply, coupled with high demand from professionals and public servants, has created a perfect storm.</p>

     Buyers face bidding wars, often needing to offer tens of thousands above asking prices. Properties sell in days, leaving little time for due diligence. Horror stories abound of buyers discovering leaky homes or shoddy renovations post-purchase, with repair costs ballooning into the hundreds of thousands. The city’s hilly terrain and older housing stock exacerbate issues like dampness and earthquake risks, yet desperate buyers overlook red flags in the rush to secure a home.

     Renters fare no better. With vacancy rates below 1%, landlords hold the upper hand, charging upwards of $600 weekly for modest flats. Stories of mouldy rentals, unaddressed maintenance, and sudden evictions are common. One renter recounted a landlord refusing to fix a leaking roof, leaving them with buckets scattered across the floor during Wellington’s notorious storms.

     Investors, meanwhile, snap up properties, further squeezing supply. Government policies, like tightened lending rules, have done little to cool the market. For many, the Kiwi dream of homeownership in Wellington feels like a cruel mirage, replaced by a reality of financial strain and housing insecurity.
