With over 15 years in sales, marketing, and business development, including leading the Marketing Division at Professionals, I’m now focused on using my experience to guide clients through the property market. My career has been centered on driving growth, building strong relationships, and creating marketing strategies that get results. Now, I’m bringing that expertise to help clients confidently navigate the property market.\n\nFor over five years, I worked closely with agents and vendors to showcase properties in the best possible light. That experience gave me an insider’s understanding of what works (and what doesn’t) when it comes to attracting the right buyers and achieving the best results.\n\nOutside of work, I’m a proud mum of two, my daughter attends Muritai School, and my son is at HIBS. I love being involved in their activities and even coach my daughter’s basketball team (which is just as competitive as the real estate market some days!).\n\nBefore all of this, I was a scholarship athlete at Southern Oregon University, where I developed the discipline, resilience, and competitive drive that still fuels me today. Whether it's crafting strategic marketing plans, presenting homes in their best light, or negotiating top-dollar sales, I love what I do and always bring my absolute best.\n\nIf you’re thinking about making a move, let’s chat!",
